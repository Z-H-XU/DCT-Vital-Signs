
Thank you very much for your attention to our work!

This representative experiments  were designed to test whether the proposed method can extract the driver's
respiratory and heartbeat signals from the radar phase signals during the fatigue state.

If you use the code, please kindly cite the following paper:  S.K. Xue, Zhihuo Xu, Y.X. Wang  et al. : Discrete Cosine Transform-Based Sparse Optimization for Simultaneous Extraction of Driver Breathing and Heartbeat
Radar Signals. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Under Review.
Thank you!
