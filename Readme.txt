
Thank you very much for your attention to our work!

These representative experiments were designed to test whether the proposed method can extract the driver's
respiratory and heartbeat signals from the radar phase signals during the fatigue state.

If you use the code, please kindly cite the following paper: Zhihuo Xu, et al. : Simultaneous Extraction of Human Breathing and Heartbeat Signals Through FMCW Millimeter-Wave Radar: A Discrete Cosine Transform-Based Sparse Optimization Approach. IEEE Transactions on Radar Systems, Under Review.

Thank you!
